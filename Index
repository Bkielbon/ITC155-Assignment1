//Write a program that uses the DrawingPanel to draw Figure The window is 220 pixels wide and 150 pixels tall. 
//The background is yellow. There are two blue ovals of size 40 × 40 pixels. They are 80 pixels apart,
//and the left oval’s top-left corner is located at position (50, 25). 
//There is a red square whose top two corners exactly intersect the centers of the two ovals.
//Lastly, there is a black horizontal line through the center of the square.
